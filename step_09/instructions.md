# Completion

Kudos to you for making it 'til the end of this workshop. Congrats!!!

In this workshop we learned:

- How to create fluid user interfaces using core Flutter widgets
- How to extract valuable screen information from the ```MediaQueryData`` (i.e. size) 
- The proper use of the ```LayoutBuilder``` widget and the constraints it provides to its children
- How to mix ```LayoutBuilder``` and ```MediaQuery``` and use them in tandem
- How to handle all your app's supported orientations and style them accordingly thanks to the "single-source-of-truth" approach using helper classes

There are other widgets that facilitate responsiveness that you should continue exploring, including:

- [OrientationBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/OrientationBuilder-class.html), different from [MediaQueryData.orientation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData/orientation.html)
- [AspectRatio](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AspectRatio-class.html)
- [FractionallySizedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FractionallySizedBox-class.html)
- [Buildinging Adaptive Apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/building-adaptive-apps)

And more!
